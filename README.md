## Spring Boot, JSF Primefaces demo

### Purpose
The purpose of this tutorial was to show how to combine Spring Boot with JSF and Primefaces in order to create a simple micro-service with an attractive front-end.

There are other tutorials on the web that people have done but I wanted to demonstrate the official Spring way, particularly I wanted to show how easy and aesthetic it can be.

### Key Technologies

This demo covers:
* Spring Boot Autoconfiguration
* Spring Data JPA
* Spring Rest
* Embedded Tomcat
* Spring Actuator
* JSF and Primefaces
* Spring/JSF interop (SpringBeanFacesELResolver)
* Jackson Repository Populators
